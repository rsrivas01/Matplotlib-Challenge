# The Power of Plots

### In this assingment we are working for the company Pymaceuticals Inc. Pymaceuticals specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. It began screening for potential treatment for squamous cell carinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

### In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus other treatment regimens.

__Tasks:__

- Generate a bar plot using Pandas's DataFrame.plot() and Matplotlib's pyplot
    - Show the number of total mice for each treatment regimen
- Generate a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens
- Select a mouse that was treated with Capomulin and generate a line plot of tumor vs volume time point for that mouse
- Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight vs average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen
- Calculate correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment

__Observations and Insights:__

The drug Capomulin seems to have a more promising result. Mice under the treatment of Capomulin have show a reduction in tumor growth and more where able to complete the study.
It seems that a mouse with a heavier weight have a better effect with the drug.
Also we could see that there was one outlier with the Infubinol drug. This mouse showed a reduction in tumor growth, but the rest didn't.
